            SymPy is an open-source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provides additional examples and further outlines details of the architecture and features of SymPy.

However, the performance of the interpreter is often a barrier when scaling to larger data sets. This paper presents a just-in-time compiler for Python that focuses in scientific and array-oriented computing. Starting with the simple syntax of Python, Numba compiles a subset of the language into efficient machine code that is comparable in performance to a traditional compiled language. In addition, we share our experience in building a JIT compiler using LLVM[1].},

@article{Jagannatha2020,
   abstract = {Numerous high-thrust and low-thrust space propulsion technologies have been developed in the recent years with the goal of expanding space exploration capabilities; however, designing and optimizing a multimission campaign with both high-thrust and low-thrust propulsion options are challenging due to the coupling between logistics mission design and trajectory evaluation. Specifically, this computational burden arises because the deliverable mass fraction (i.e., final-to-initial mass ratio) and time of flight for low-thrust trajectories can vary with the payload mass; thus, these trajectory metrics cannot be evaluated separately from the campaign-level mission design. To tackle this challenge, this paper develops a novel event-driven space logistics network optimization approach using mixed-integer linear programming for space campaign design. An example case of optimally designing a cislunar propellant supply chain to support multiple lunar surface access missions is used to demonstrate this new space logistics framework. The results are compared with an existing stochastic combinatorial formulation developed for incorporating low-thrust propulsion into space logistics design; this new approach provides superior results in terms of cost as well as utilization of the vehicle fleet. The event-driven space logistics network optimization method developed in this paper can trade off cost, time, and technology in an automated manner to optimally design space mission campaigns.},

@article{Shimane2023,
   abstract = {This work proposes an adaptation of the facility location problem for the optimal placement of on-orbit servicing depots for satellite constellations in high-altitude orbit. The high-altitude regime, such as medium Earth orbit, is a unique dynamic environment where low-thrust propulsion systems can provide the necessary thrust to conduct plane-change maneuvers between the various orbital planes of the constellation. As such, on-orbit servicing architectures involving servicer spacecraft that conduct roundtrips between servicing depots and the client satellites of the constellation may be conceived. To this end, a new orbital facility location problem formulation is proposed based on binary linear programming, in which the costs of operating and allocating the facility(ies) to satellites are optimized in terms of the sum of the effective mass to low Earth orbit (EMLEO). The low-thrust transfers between the facilities and the clients are computed using a parallel implementation of a Lyapunov feedback controller. The total launch cost of the depot, along with its servicers, propellant, and payload, is taken into account as the cost to establish a given depot. The proposed approach is applied to designing an on-orbit servicing depot architecture for the Galileo and the GPS constellations.},
